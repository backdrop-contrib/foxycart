FoxyCart
========

The FoxyCart module makes it extremely easy to quick to integrate with the
[Foxy](https://www.foxy.io) e-commerce system. This module provides:

* Automatic inclusion of necessary foxy.io javascript file to enable your site.
* Theme-able shopping cart and status blocks.
* Tight single-sign on integration with Backdrop. Customers use their Backdrop
  account to complete checkout with FoxyCart.
* Foxy datafeed logging. Transactions reported by Foxy are logged into the
  Backdrop logging system.

One of FoxyCart's biggest benefits is to act as a substitute for UberCart's
checkout process while keeping the back-end system. This allows for a quick and
safe checkout experience and a versatile product administration system. The
FoxyCart Ubercart Alternative module is separately enabled to provide these
additional Foxy features:

* Product options, such as size, color, etc
* Product categories allowing different tax and shipping configurations
* Purchasable roles. Allow users to purchase a Backdrop role using Foxy
